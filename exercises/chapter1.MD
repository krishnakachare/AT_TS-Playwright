# Introduction to Playwright

Hi 👋🏽!

Welcome to the course "Introduction to Playwright" by [Shrikrishna Kachare] ..

## Chapter 1 - Exercises

1. Take a look at the 2 test files that were created [example.spec.ts](/tests/example.spec.ts) and [demo-todo-app.spec.ts](/tests-examples/demo-todo-app.spec.ts) and get familiar with the terminology used there. Maybe use the Search available on the [Website](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) to learn more about the commands.

1. Run the tests using the UI Mode and also the command line. What differences do you see?

1. Take a look at the other existing files (listed below) and try to identify their function in the project:
- [.gitignore](/.gitignore)
- [package-lock.json](/package-lock.json)
- [package-lock.json](/package-lock.json)
- [playwright.config.ts](/playwright.config.ts)
