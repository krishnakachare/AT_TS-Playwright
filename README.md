- [VS Code setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/basics)
- [iTerm setup](https://iterm2.com/documentation-one-page.html)

## Fork and clone the project

1. Copy the project URL `https://github.com/krishnakachare/AT_TS-Playwright.git`;
2. Fork the project following the [GitHub instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) - (use the parameter --clone=true);

## Instal the project

On your terminal, type:

1. `npm i`

IMPORTANT: to run the tests from `main`, you'll need to setup your [.env](.env) following the [.env.example](.env.example), otherwise many tests will fail - this setup is explained in the Chapter 4 video. The recommendation is to access each branch (`git checkout [branchname]`) and run the tests from the branch.
